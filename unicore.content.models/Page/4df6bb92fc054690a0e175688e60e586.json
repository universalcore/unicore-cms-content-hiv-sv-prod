  "content": "Answer: NO, not at all. HIV cannot be transmitted through sharing meals.\r\n \r\nHIV is transmitted only through contact with five bodily fluids: 1) blood, 2) semen, 3) vaginal fluid, 4) rectal fluids and 5) breast milk. HIV is most commonly transmitted through sexual intercourse with a person living with HIV, through sharing needles during drug use, and from mother to child during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding. All of these methods of transmission can be prevented. Using a condom during sex, using clean needles, and adhering to antiretroviral therapy if you are living with HIV all greatly reduce the chance of transmission.\r\n\r\nNext Question:\r\n",
